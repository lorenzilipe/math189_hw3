## Overview
In this report we are trying to study the origin of DNA replication by looking for unusual clusters of palindromes within a DNA sequence. Our dataset 
comprises the DNA locations of the 296 palindromes (at least 10 letters long) found in the Cytomegalovirus DNA molecule, which contains 229,354 
complementary base pairs.

The main goal of this analysis is to investigate the distribution of palindromes across the CMV DNA sequence. In this analysis, we use numerical 
summaries and graphical methods to describe the distribution of palindromes across our dataset, as well as across 10 simulations of uniform 
distributions of 296 palindrome locations (out of 229,354).
